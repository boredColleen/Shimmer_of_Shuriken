Chapter 7: Pursuit of Shadows

Leo, Pat, Carl, and Elara were on the verge of meeting Oriana in the sacred temple, but on the other side of darkness, a different chapter was unfolding.

The hooded figures had returned to their hidden lair after the unexpected encounter with the newcomers. They waited in the shadowy corners of their secret hideout, tense and uneasy, knowing they had to report their failure. Their boss remained obscured in darkness, a figure that invoked both fear and submission.

One of the hooded figures, their voice quivering with anxiety, spoke up, "We were ambushed, boss. An outsider—a young girl—was with them. They... they rescued her."

The boss's voice filled the room like a venomous whisper. "An outsider, you say? Tell me more."

The trembling figure continued, "There were three men among them from the outside, and the elder one was extraordinary, clearly a martial artist of considerable skill. The others were strong and determined as well. Moreover, they appeared to be on a purposeful journey, moving with intent."

The boss's eyes gleamed with dangerous curiosity. "This might be the movement we've feared for a long time. If they too are after what we seek, we cannot let them roam freely."

As the hooded figures elaborated on the situation and the outsiders' movements, the boss made a swift decision. "Summon the brethren. We cannot afford to let these outsiders pass us by. We cannot allow them an opportunity to intercept what we seek."

Outside the hideout, the night sky was on the verge of giving way to the dawn, and it seemed as if a celestial spectacle of meteor showers had been foreseen, akin to a mysterious omen for an impending pursuit. The hooded figures were emerging one by one, while the brethren summoned by the boss were already on the move, determined to track down Leo, Pat, Carl, and Elara and capture them.

Unbeknownst to them, their paths were destined to intersect once more, and as Aerithor's fate became increasingly uncertain with the onset of the pursuit of shadows, they hurtled towards an increasingly ambiguous future.
