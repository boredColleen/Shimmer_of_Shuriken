Chapter 12: Clash

Leo and Pat felt a deep sense of familiarity as they each gripped the Secret Sword and the bow in their hands. Leo swung the sword, feeling as if he possessed the skills of a master swordsman. Furthermore, the weight of the sword and the power it exuded from the hilt seemed to instill Leo with a newfound confidence, as if it granted him a mysterious strength. Pat, on the other hand, tested the bow, realizing he had acquired the ability to shoot arrows swiftly and accurately, even in practice. Both of them shared satisfied smiles, appreciating the mysterious power and abilities of their respective weapons.

In that moment, Elara urgently exclaimed, "Hey, look over there in the plain. There's a group of pursuers coming our way."

Leo and Pat turned their attention to the direction Elara pointed. In the distance, they could see a cloud of dust rising as a group approached rapidly. It was Jackal's pursuit party.

Alerted by Elara's warning, Leo and Pat nervously prepared their weapons and surveyed the nearby hills once again. They needed to find a favorable position to engage the enemy, making the most of their time. Armed with their mysterious weapons, they calmly found their positions and readied themselves for their first battle.

As the pursuit party came into shooting range, Pat swiftly released an arrow, precisely hitting one of the front-runners. The sound of a horn in the distance signaled the beginning of the attack.

Following this, a shield unit advanced, bearing the brunt of most of the arrow attacks. Behind them, a strike force prepared for a follow-up assault. As the pursuit party reached the hill, a full-fledged battle ensued.

Leo brandished the mysterious sword Oriana had given him and faced their adversaries with skills that surpassed his expectations. Pat continued to pull his bowstring, providing accurate support for his comrades. Though they enjoyed transcendent abilities through their mysterious weapons, their lack of real combat experience and the challenge of maximizing the weapons' potential proved to be difficult.

On the other hand, Jackal's pursuit party was composed of elite forces. Initially, the battle was intense, thanks to the extraordinary weapons and the geographical advantage held by Leo's group.

As time passed, the momentum of the battle began to shift in favor of their adversaries. Elara eventually decided to use the small bombs and smoke grenades she had brought from the village as a last resort. They threw explosives and smoke grenades from their high vantage point, barely managing to deter the remaining enemies.

When the battle had quieted down, the trio was left battered and bruised. They lay on the ground, losing consciousness.

Hours later, it was around sunset when the ground's unsettling vibrations roused them. Another pursuit party was spotted, but this time, it was a new, more formidable adversary. "It's Jackal!"

Leo and Pat instinctively recognized the presence of Jackal. The sight of his surrounding guard was all too familiar.

At that moment, Jackal raised his head, seemingly gazing in their direction, despite the considerable distance between them.

The group fell silent for a moment, feeling as though they had lost all hope. Their mysterious weapons and explosives had proven ineffective. Jackal's gleaming banner was a stark reminder of their formidable enemy.

They had to snap back to reality. They regrouped and began preparing for the battle. A short while later, Jackal arrived. He ordered his subordinates to stay back, approaching the group alone. Pat drew his bowstring, launching a powerful arrow at Jackal. Leo wielded his mysterious sword with all his might against the nearly defenseless Jackal. In a gap, Elara threw a bomb in an attempt to destabilize Jackal.

After the smoke from the explosion cleared, it was a cruel reality that Jackal appeared unharmed and composed.

Without hesitation, Jackal, as if determined to eliminate Leo's group, raised the sword in his hand and swung it toward them. Leo's party, in the face of Jackal's overwhelming presence, dared not challenge him.

As they thought it was all over, a resounding clang! An immense weapon striking against another caused the entire area to resonate with a thunderous noise. Someone had intercepted Jackal's colossal attack.

In a fit of anger, Jackal spoke, "Valkyrie, are you insane? Why are you obstructing me?"

Valkyrie, the enigmatic warrior who could stand up to Jackal, was one of the few beings capable of doing so. She, too, served the Darklord. Her flag was similarly gleaming, but her atmosphere was subtly different.

Shortly after, in the shifting sands of the desert, a fierce battle erupted between Jackal and Valkyrie, two powerful warriors.

Leo and Pat managed to fend off Jackal's subordinates, securing a momentary safe haven with Elara. As they hid behind the rocks, they watched the battle unfold, unable to do anything else.

From a distance, the fiery rage of Jackal, from head to toe, was matched by Valkyrie's determination, no less potent. "My mission concerning Oriana has been entrusted to me. You can build your temple; you have no right to interfere here."

Their conflict continued, a battle of determination and loyalty, amidst the silent flashes of light and the storm raging through the desert. Leo, Pat, and Elara watched, while nothing else seemed possible in this unprecedented situation.

As the sands settled, and the storm subsided, the desert bore traces of the merciless clash between Valkyrie and Jackal, while Leo, Pat, and Elara, battered and bloodied, had to catch their breath.
