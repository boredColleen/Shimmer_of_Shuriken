Chapter 9: Invasion of Darkness

As Leo, Pat, and Elara hurried on their journey to find the sacred Shuriken sword, a grim scene unfolded back at the Mirage Haven they had left behind.

Jackal, a manifestation of darkness leading his horde of minions, seemed relentless in his quest to devastate the village. Upon his return, he wasted no time and began capturing the villagers mercilessly, leaving the village in shambles. The peace that had once defined the village was now shattered by the presence of malevolence.

Fires blazed in various locations, illuminating the night sky, while Jackal's orders were clear - destroy the village, capture the remaining residents, and seize any knowledge or artifacts related to the sacred Shuriken sword.

Buildings lay in ruins, and the once-thriving community had crumbled into despair. The scent of destruction and the thick, smoky air filled the surroundings. The residents' agonizing cries echoed through the night.

Jackal himself reveled in his newly regained power, his cruel smile almost indestructible. He exuded no mercy, and his ruthlessness was enough to make even his minions wary and fearful.

Innocent villagers, men, women, and children, all became merciless targets for conscription. Those deemed useful were cruelly captured, their captors hoping to extract any information or details about the Shuriken sword. Those who resisted were brutally put to death, gradually deterring any further resistance.

The weight of the assault caused the village to crumble, and Jackal's cruelty knew no bounds. He reveled in the chaos he had sown and savored the unending fear and despair that emanated from every corner of the village.

Soon after, Jackal's subordinates, who had gone on an expedition to the outskirts of the village, returned with prisoners. Among them were some who had tracked Leo and Pat and had fought against Carl's group. Just like Jackal's minions, they too bore the marks of their battles, having been dragged here.

Having extracted information from those who had embarked on their quest for the sacred Shuriken sword, Jackal menacingly threatened them for details about Leo's group.

Jackal displayed no urgency. Without delay, he began assembling a pursuit team, composed of his most ruthless subordinates, to locate Leo, Pat, and Elara and retrieve the sacred Shuriken sword.

While the village crumbled, construction of the temple for the Darklord was underway elsewhere. Countless villagers worked day and night to fulfill their task.

With Jackal's pursuit team ready, their determination to confront Leo's group grew stronger, and they set off, leaving the village.

As the night's darkness settled in, they embarked into the desert. Leo, Pat, and Elara's journey became more perilous than ever before. Aerithor's fate itself became intertwined in a complex path of crossroads. The pursuit from the forces of darkness emerged as an unprecedented, intensified threat, and without even Carl as their guardian, the quest for the sacred Shuriken sword became a more arduous and challenging endeavor, one that extended into a battle with the darkness.
