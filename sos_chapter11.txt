Chapter 11: The Advance of Darkness

The desert night was silent. Only the occasional sound of the frigid wind, devoid of any warning, rustled through the air. Jackal, the absolute force leading the Darklord's army, stood at the village entrance, gathering his subordinates and issuing commands. Jackal's voice, marked with brutal self-assurance, was clear and had a restrained power mingled with charisma that compelled listeners to follow him unquestioningly.

"Crush those who resist," he ordered to the legions of dark demons. "Those who dare to challenge us, eliminate them without mercy. Ensure that the remaining ones do not hesitate even for a moment in enslaving the captives for the construction of the Darklord's temple."

His subordinates were unquestionably obedient and merciless, and there seemed to be no doubt that they would execute his commands without hesitation. This village, once peaceful, was now plunged into destruction and chaos after Jackal's occupation, and the cries of innocent people echoed through the nights.

Houses and buildings lay in ruins, and the village's residents were forced into slavery as tools for temple construction.

With a sinister gleam of anticipation, Jackal, who seemed to take pleasure in the destruction, shouted to his subordinates. "We must swiftly complete the glorious temple of the Darklord. His return is drawing nearer, and we must be prepared to welcome him with no negligence."

Then, as if guided by an unseen force, Jackal turned his gaze towards the desert. A strange sensation swept over him, and in a low, eerie voice, he said, "Anyone who dares to obstruct us will be annihilated without a trace."

It appeared as if Jackal could sense the presence and movements of Leo's group as if he had the ability to resonate with their existence. His evil intentions were evident in his grim smile as the darkness within him intensified.

"Those who dare to resist us will be eliminated sooner than they could imagine," he proclaimed.

As if driven by the power of darkness, an ominous smile crept over Jackal's lips, and he continued, "I have a premonition that I'll get my hands on those insignificant objects far sooner than expected. Call the guards; I must go and eliminate them myself."

Jackal seemed to be expanding with the power of darkness as if he felt that pressure inside him. Simultaneously, the pursuit team he had dispatched raced towards Leo's group with terrifying speed.
