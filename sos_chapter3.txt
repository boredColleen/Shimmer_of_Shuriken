Chapter 3: Harbingers of Darkness

It has been 10 days since Leo and Pat left the village. The scorching heat and emptiness of the desert have left them restless and weary, with even their sense of direction wavering due to uncertainty.

As they looked back, when they were about to leave the village, the ground beneath them frequently trembled, and traces of lava, along with Jackal's subordinates, were often spotted in the village.

At first, they seemed to roam aimlessly without a clear purpose, but as their numbers grew, their intentions began to surface. They were preparing for the arrival of a formidable force under Jackal's command.

Faced with the impending threat to Mirage Haven, the villagers gathered in the community hall to hold a crucial meeting. As they struggled to formulate an action plan in their weary state, tensions ran high, and reaching a unanimous decision proved to be a challenge. Some advocated for an immediate evacuation, while others hoped to stay. The only common ground was that no one dared to entertain the idea of confronting these merciless monsters in battle. They were peaceful people, and the notion of challenging these ruthless creatures was an unimaginable task.

As the number of monsters exceeded a hundred, escaping from Mirage Haven became increasingly perilous. The monsters effectively blocked the eastern route leading to a neighboring village. The only escape route was to the west, into the treacherous desert.

Finally, the terrifying leader of the monsters, Jackal, arrived. Chaos engulfed the village, and people rushed back to their homes, worried about events unfolding outside, glimpsing them through windows.

Leo and his childhood friend, Pat, sought refuge together in Leo's parents' house. Their friendship, forged from their early years, was now their greatest solace. Seeking a brief moment of respite, Leo and Pat joined Leo's parents in the living room. Leo's father, Matt, began to speak in a voice tinged with concern.

"Leo, listen closely," Matt started, his voice heavy with worry.

"Yes, Dad," Leo responded, locking eyes with his father.

Matt motioned for Pat to join them. "And you too, Pat."

Sara, Leo's mother, entered with an herb tea tray, hands trembling slightly. She extinguished a nearby candle and poured herbal tea into cups for everyone.

In the dimly lit room, a palpable tension hung in the air. The future of Mirage Haven was uncertain, overshadowed by the menacing presence of Jackal and his horde of monsters. In this moment of uncertainty, Leo, Pat, and Leo's parents were about to make difficult decisions that would shape their destinies in the days to come.
